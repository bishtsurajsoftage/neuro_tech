# Brain-interface research 
## Electroencephalography : 
- EEG-based BCIs measure electrical activity in the brain throught electrodes placed on
  the scalp. This non - invasive method is often used for applications such as neurofeedback,
  communication.
## Invasive Brain Interfaces:
- Invasive involve implanting electrodes directly into the brain.
  This can progide higher precision .
