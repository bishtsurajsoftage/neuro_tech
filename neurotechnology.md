## Neurotechnology 
# Electroencephalography : 
- EEG measures electrical activity in the brain by placing
  electrodes on the scalp. It is commonly used for studying brain
  waves, diagnosing neurological disorders, and in brain - computer interface.

# Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging :
- FMRI is non - invasive imaging technique that measures changes in blood flow to
  different regions of the brain.

# Magnetoencephalography :
- MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by neural activity
